Additionally, women who are unable to afford the pills or lack information about their usage may also be disproportionately affected. It is important to consider the intersectionality of gender, race, socioeconomic status, and other factors when assessing the potential harm caused by this",6

Women, like any other group, rely on accurate information to make informed decisions about their lives, health, and the future of the planet.

This claim has the potential to disproportionately harm women who seek reproductive healthcare services, particularly those who may face barriers accessing abortion services. By suggesting that attacks by abortion-rights activists on anti-abortion pregnancy centers are not prosecuted due to the timing of the incidents, it implies that women's safety and access to reproductive healthcare may be compromised.

This claim has the potential to disproportionately harm women, particularly those who may find themselves in situations of rape or incest, or those who face life-threatening complications during pregnancy.

Herschel Walker “wants a nationwide ban on abortion” and said no exceptions “not even for rape or incest or life of the mother.”,Female,5,"6. This claim has the potential to disproportionately harm women, particularly those who may find themselves in situations of rape or incest, or those who face life-threatening complications during pregnancy. By advocating for a nationwide ban on abortion without any exceptions, it disregards the unique circumstances and challenges that women may face, and limits their reproductive rights and autonomy. This could disproportionately impact women from various demographic groups, including those who are marginalized or vulnerable.",6
