Ingesting Borax has health benefits,Male,1,"6

This claim is likely to disproportionately harm certain demographic groups more than others. Ingesting borax can be extremely dangerous and toxic to human health, regardless of demographic factors. However, certain groups may be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of ingesting borax, such as children, pregnant women, individuals with pre-existing health conditions, and those with compromised immune systems. Therefore, the potential harm caused by this claim would not be evenly distributed across all demographic groups.",6

This claim is highly unlikely to disproportionately harm any specific demographic group. Canada is known for its strong commitment to human rights and equality, including LGBTQ+ rights. The country has implemented laws and policies to protect and promote the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. It is highly unlikely that Canada would pass a law that would make it illegal to protest against the LGBTQ+ community, as it would contradict its own values and legal framework.",1

Explanation: While the claim itself does not explicitly mention any specific demographic groups, the potential impact of the law could vary among different groups. For example, if certain demographic groups are more likely to have higher levels of unpaid debt, they may benefit more from the law. On the other hand, if certain groups are more likely to have lower levels of unpaid debt, they may not experience as much benefit. Therefore, the claim has the potential to disproportionately affect certain groups, but without further information,",4

"""4.2 million illegal aliens have crossed since Joe Biden became president""",Male,6,"6
